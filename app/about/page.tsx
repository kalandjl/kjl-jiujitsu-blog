                I thought this website could be a cool project to track my progress
                as I climb the ranks of jiu jitsu. Along with that, I had been 
                looking for a website idea for a while, so when I realized I could
                combine the 2 (coding and jiu jitsu), I was all for it. I hope anyone 
                reading this enjoys the layout and features I spent time on creating,
                and if you have any suggesting or questions you can find my info on the
                contact page.
